__The api calls are limited, please share them amongst yourselves, 2 campers per key.__

As you  use them mark update the read-me marking them as used.

__If the api responds with status 401, it means the api key is still not activated, please allow a few moments to be activated.__

In the meantime make sure you pimp out your app
