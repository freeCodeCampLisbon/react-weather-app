**The api calls are limited, please share them amongst yourselves, 2 campers per key.**

As you use them, update the read-me marking them as used.

**If the api responds with status 401, it means the api key is still not activated, please allow a few moments to be activated.**

In the meantime make sure you pimp out your app
